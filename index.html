            <p>A new coronavirus virus, emerged at the end of December, 
                has killed at least <b>17</b> people and sickened more than <b>570</b>, including in Taiwan,
                 Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States. As of 27 January, 
                 the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than <b>2,700 cases</b> and <b>56 deaths</b>. 
                 In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled.
                 It has raised the specter of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis.

        The coronavirus spreading in China and the SARS outbreak of 2003 have two things in common: <b>Both are from the coronavirus family, and both likely started with animal.</b>
        The coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of South China. 
        The civet is used in the popular "Dragon-Tiger-Phoenix Soup," which is believed by locals to help with arthritis, stimulate poor blood flow and revive decreased libido, according to Slate. 
        Though China's demand for wild animals is largely driven by the belief that these animals provide health benefits when consumed,<b>"Poorly regulated, live-animal markets mixed with illegal wildlife trade offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spillover from wildlife hosts into the human population," </b>
        the Wildlife Conservation Society said in a statement.
        At such markets, outdoor stalls are squeezed together to form narrow lanes, where locals and visitors shop for cuts of meat and ripe produce.
        A stall selling hundreds of caged chickens may abut a butcher counter, where uncooked meat is chopped as nearby dogs watch hungrily. 
           Vendors hock skinned hares, while seafood stalls display glistening fish and shrimp.
           These markets put people and live and dead animals - dogs, chicken, pigs, snakes, civets, and more - in constant close contact. 
           That makes it easy for a virus to jump from animal to human.

        On January 22, authorities in Wuhan, China - where the current outbreak started - <b>banned the trade of live animals</b> at wet markets. 
        Reports indicated that before the Huanan market closed, vendors there sold processed meats and live animals, including chickens, donkeys, sheep, pigs, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs, and snakes.

        Racing to contain the outbreak, Beijing now faces uncomfortable questions over its failure to clean up the <b>wildlife trade</b> in recent years. 
        It is also confronting unusual public calls in China for a permanent ban on wild meat, something it has been reluctant to impose for fear of angering its relatively wealthy aficionados.
        <b>President Xi Jinping</b> of China has spoken about the country's ability to show leadership on global issues, such as public health. His response to the current crisis is likely to be seen as an important test, health experts and political analysts said.
        "This incident should be used as an opportunity to rectify the chaos" in China's wildlife trade, said a petition published on Thursday by 19 prominent Chinese scientists, including a former head of Peking University.
